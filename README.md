# Bioimage analysis with Python

A lesson teaching fundamentals of bioimage analysis with Python focused on fluorescence microscopy derived from the original [Image Processing with Python](https://github.com/datacarpentry/image-processing) lesson.

This is lesson is **currently under heavy development**. Keep an eye of the [Issues](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/bioimage-analysis-python/issues) and Pull Requests to see what is being worked on.

## Lesson Content

The lesson content is still being developed. 

See the [CodiMD document](https://codimd.carpentries.org/_XWgpty6Q06VpTmBUA4CWw?edit) written together in our first in-person workshop to see current ideas.
